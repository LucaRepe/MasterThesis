## Anti-disassembly techniques check


Angr
In BBs 0x1263 0x126b there might be a CJWST technique
In BB 0x1154 there might be a CJWCC technique
In BB 0x11d0 there might be a CJWCC technique
In BB 0x120f there might be a ID technique
In BB 0x12e3 there might be a ID technique
In BB 0x12e3 there might be a ID technique


Ghidra
In BB 0x1154 there might be a CJWCC technique


Ida
In BB 0x1154 there might be a CJWCC technique


Radare
In BBs 0x1263 0x126b there might be a CJWST technique
In BB 0x1154 there might be a CJWCC technique
In BB 0x11d0 there might be a CJWCC technique
In BB 0x120f there might be a ID technique


## Pin subset check on original addresses


Pin trace addresses: 124
Angr is True - addresses: 393
Ghidra is True - addresses: 292
Ida is True - addresses: 292
Radare is True - addresses: 404


Addresses present on the Pin trace that are missing in Angr: 0
Addresses present on the Pin trace that are missing in Ghidra: 0
Addresses present on the Pin trace that are missing in Ida: 0
Addresses present on the Pin trace that are missing in Radare: 0
