Angr returns some errors regarding unsupported statements from VEX like CAS, GetI, PutI.
IDA does not split basic blocks at function calls. angr will, because they are a form of control flow and basic blocks
end at control flow instructions. You generally do not need the supergraph for performing automated analyses.

How to treat when the last instruction is a CALL?

The graph has 537 nodes and 753 edges.

_pre_c_init

    Angr starts at 0x401000, IDA at 0x401010

___tmainCRTStartup

    At 0x40120A IDA CALL Sleep(x) but Angr has UnresolvableCallTarget
    
    Angr at 0x401213 has as edges 2 of the 3 steps of the loop: 0x401202 and 0x401216

    At 0x401241 IDA considers as bb a MOV instruction, Angr correctly recognizes it.

    At 0x40124D9 IDA considers as bb a MOV instruction, Angr correctly recognizes it.

    At 0x401360 IDA considers as bb a MOV instruction, Angr correctly recognizes it.

    At 0x4014AB Angr fallthrough in 0x4014B3, IDA doesn't.

    At 0x401404 Angr doesn't fallthrough, IDA does in 0x401409

_WinMainCRTStartup

    0x4014C0 ins't listed as a node in Angr, starts from 0x4014D2.

__dyn_tls_init(x,x,x)

    At 0x401580 ins't listed as a node in Angr, starts from 0x401591.

    At 0x401591 IDA considers as bb a MOV instruction, Angr correctly recognizes it.
        Angr has ad edge that points at the bb.

_gnu_exception_handler(x) Not totally analyzed.

__matherr

    At 0x401946 IDA considers as bb a MOV instruction, Angr correctly recognizes it.

    At 0x401946 Angr has an edge on himself, doesn't fallthrough on 0x401985.

___report_error

    At 0x401990 fallthrough in 0x4019e1, correct?
