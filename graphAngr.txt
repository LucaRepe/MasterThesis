Angr returns some errors regarding unsupported statements from VEX like CAS, GetI, PutI.
IDA does not split basic blocks at function calls. angr will, because they are a form of control flow and basic blocks
end at control flow instructions. You generally do not need the supergraph for performing automated analyses.
